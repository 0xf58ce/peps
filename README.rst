### Has this already been discussed elsewhere?

I have already discussed this feature proposal on Discourse

### Links to previous discussion of this feature:

https://peps.python.org/. To learn more about the purpose of PEPs and how to go
about writing one, please start reading at :pep:`1`. Note that the PEP Index
(:pep:`0`) is automatically generated based on the metadata headers in other PEPs.


Canonical links
===============

The canonical form of PEP links are zero-padded, such as
``https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/``.

Shortcut redirects are also available.
For example, ``https://peps.python.org/8`` redirects to the canonical link.


Contributing to PEPs
====================

See the `Contributing Guidelines <./CONTRIBUTING.rst>`_.


Checking PEP formatting and rendering
=====================================

Please don't commit changes with reStructuredText syntax errors that cause PEP
generation to fail, or result in major rendering defects relative to what you
intend.


Browse the "Read the Docs" preview
----------------------------------

For every PR, we automatically create a preview of the rendered PEPs using
`Read the Docs <https://about.readthedocs.com>`_.
You can find it in the merge box at the bottom of the PR page:

1. Click "Show all checks" to expand the checks section
2. Find the line for ``docs/readthedocs.org:pep-previews``
3. Click on "Details" to the right


Render PEPs locally
-------------------

See the `build documentation <./docs/build.rst>`__ for full
instructions on how to render PEPs locally.
In summary, run the following in a fresh, activated virtual environment:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Install requirements
    python -m pip install -U -r requirements.txt

    # Build the PEPs
    make html

    # Or, if you don't have 'make':
    python build.py

The output HTML is found under the ``build`` directory.


Check and lint PEPs
-------------------

You can check for and fix common linting and spelling issues,
either on-demand or automatically as you commit, with our pre-commit suite.
See the `Contributing Guide <./CONTRIBUTING.rst>`_ for details.
